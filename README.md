Iâ€™m a research data scientist at [RTI](https://rti.org), modeling communicable and noncommunicable disease, 
and graduate student in the Applied and Computational Mathematics program at [Johns Hopkins](https://jhu.edu). 
My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematics, computational methods, and biological systems.
